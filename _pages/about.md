I am a 4th year PhD student in [Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins University](https://cogsci.jhu.edu), advised by [Kyle Rawlins](https://rawlins.io/).

I study representations of meaning in natural language discourse, with particular interests in discourse structure and the semantics of perspective. My work draws on methods from formal semantics and pragmatics, computational modeling, and psychological research.

Prior to coming to Hopkins, I did my bachelors degree in Computer Science, Linguistics, and Cognitive Science at [Rutgers University, New Brunswick](https://ruccs.rutgers.edu).

Outside of research, I enjoy cooking, gardening, reading, and [long-distance](https://ultrarunning.com/calendar/runner/show?first_name=Karl&last_name=Mulligan&runner_id=406822) running.
