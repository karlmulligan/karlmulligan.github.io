I'm an incoming PhD student in [Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University, starting Fall 2019. I'll be working in the [Computation and Psycholinguistics Lab](https://caplabjhu.org), advised by Tal Linzen. 

Broadly, I'm interested in the representations behind language production and understanding. I hope to characterize how supervision and context contribute to linguistic development, and in particular what role information from extralinguistic cognitive processes, like numerical or spatial cognition, might play. My work uses methods from formal linguistics, machine learning, and psychological research. 

I did my bachelors degree in Computer Science, Linguistics, and Cognitive Science at Rutgers University, New Brunswick.
